# Final Exam

The final exam will be a closed book exam written with pen/pencil and paper and will be three (3) hours in duration. 
Questions in the exam will come from all aspects of the course material: lectures, assignments and required readings. 
The written exam may include questions around computer / statistical code, so be prepared to provide answers that require you to write short code snippets or explain what a piece of code is doing.

* PART A: True/False/Uncertain with an explanation (20%), 
* PART B: Short answer questions (40%), and 
* PART C: An open-ended/essay style question (40%)
