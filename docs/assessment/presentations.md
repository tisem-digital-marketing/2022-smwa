## Format

From Week 2 onwards, there will be two presentation slots in each Lab Section, each lasting 30 minutes.

Format:

* **Presentation**: 15 mins, answering prompts allocated below.
* **Panel Discussion**: approx. 10 mins of Q & A from another group.
* **Open Discussion**: remaining time. 

*Panel Discussion*: For each week, the two teams take turns as panel leading the Q & A.
For example, when Group 1A presents, Group 1B takes the role of the Q & A panel and vice versa.
Questions should be designed around developing a deeper understanding of the material presented, either in terms of marketing/managerial implications or details around the findings presented.

## Groups

Students will give group presentations twice in their Lab Section, once between Weeks 2 and 4 and again between Weeks 5 and 7.
Students are randomly assigned to two groups, one per presentation.
