# Group Presentations

## Format

From Week 2 onwards, there will be two presentation slots in each Lab Section, each lasting 30 minutes.

Format:

* **Presentation**: 15 mins, answering prompts allocated below.
* **Panel Discussion**: approx. 10 mins of Q & A from another group.
* **Open Discussion**: remaining time. 

!!! tip "Panel Discussion"
    **Who will be the panel?** 

    * For each week, the two teams take turns as panel leading the Q & A.
    * For example, when Group 1A presents, Group 1B takes the role of the Q & A panel and vice versa.

    **What should the panel ask?** 
    
    Potential questions could be based around:

    * Developing a deeper understanding of the managerial / marketing implications
    * Details on empirical strategy 
    * Interpretation of results

## Groups

Students will give group presentations twice in their Lab Section, once between Weeks 2 and 4 and again between Weeks 5 and 7.
Students are randomly assigned to two groups, one per presentation.

**Group Allocations**: See Canvas.

Topics will be posted 2 weeks before a scheduled presentation so that all teams have an equal amount of preparation time.
