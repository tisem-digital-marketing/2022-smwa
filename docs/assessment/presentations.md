# Group Presentations

## Format

From Week 2 onwards, there will be two presentation slots in each Lab Section, each lasting 30 minutes.

Format:

* **Presentation**: 15 mins, answering prompts allocated below.
* **Panel Discussion**: approx. 10 mins of Q & A from another group.
* **Open Discussion**: remaining time. 

!!! tip "Panel Discussion"
    **Who will be the panel?** 

    * For each week, the two teams take turns as panel leading the Q & A.
    * For example, when Group A presents, Group B takes the role of the Q & A panel and vice versa.

    **What should the panel ask?** 
    
    Potential questions could be based around:

    * Developing a deeper understanding of the managerial / marketing implications
    * Details on empirical strategy 
    * Interpretation of results

## Groups

Students will give group presentations twice in their Lab Section, once between Weeks 2 and 4 and again between Weeks 5 and 7.
Students are randomly assigned to two groups, one per presentation.

**Group Allocations**: See Canvas.

## Topics

Use the knowledge developed in the course from readings and lectures as a starting point to construct an answer to the following prompts. 
You should use your research skills to go looking for additional material as necessary.

    All scenarios are entirely hypothetical, and do not reflect actual scenarios or current areas on research that any named company is facing or working on to the best of my knowledge. 

Topics will be posted 2 weeks before a scheduled presentation so that all teams have an equal amount of preparation time.

**Week 1**

No presentations.

**Week 2**

*Topic 1*: 

TikTok’s User Experience team is worried about the amount of lurkers on their platform and wants to design a new strategy to get them to engage with or post content. Propose a potential strategy that could lead to increases in either form of engagement by lurkers along with an empirical strategy to test whether the strategy is effective.

*Topic 2*:

Reddit’s Customer Analytics team wants to understand potential reasons why users contribute to their site, either by posting original content or commenting on the posts of others. Design a project that can potentially disentangle user motivations along with an empirical strategy to test for the prevalence of the each, and potentially classify a user by their motivations.
